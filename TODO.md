* Make dragstate passing minimum info: difs, pointer (plot) coords
	* keep pickerbox data in picker objects, not in dragstate


* Make external placing functions

* Make multiple different pickers
	* Think of moving to the separate class: different placing fns, different values, different mapping, different events, different settings, instances.

* Count on mobile devices touchdragging

* Count vertical, horizontal scrolling

* make shapes in basic case (including SVG)
* make grid display (show some snapping lines)
* make pins right on the plot

* get/set value API for case of one picker
	* reversive transfer, mapping & placing fn's
